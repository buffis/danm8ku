Bullet engine/game for CHIP-8 using Octo ASM.

Can be played here:
http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?gist=364431640b0206cae818

ASWD controls to move ship.

The game is still a WIP, but I'm reasonably pleased with the bullet engine.

Engine is meant to run at 1000/cycles per frame in Octo.
